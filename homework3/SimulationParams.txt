Simulation Report
CSCI 447
Nat Choeypant

For my simulation, I tested my simulation by starting at the smallest set of values (1,1), 
then increment by 1 for each element (1,2), (2,2), (3,2).

During the simulation, it seemed that my simulation processed every processes from the file, 
but the schedule algorithm seemed to order all processes exactly the same.

After running this simulation, there is no optimal set of values for this simulation 
because it will schedule all processes the same.

Here is the script of my simulation:
